    <p>
        A SoftwareLinks-ENLARGE element provides an implementation of ENLARGE communications to access any software or
        device within an ENLARGE system.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
        To add a SoftwareLinks-ENLARGE element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your model elements
        and set the name of the variable for referring to the element.
        The connection can be configured in the preferences window: the address of the ENLARGE server, the port to establish
        the connection, the path (which you only need to change in case og myGateway devices) and, the experience id.
        The "Secure connection" checkbox must be ticked if your ENLARGE server has an SSL certificate and you want c
        ommunications to be secure.
        ENLARGE user and password fields may be filled with your ENLARGE user data. If left blank, the application will
        show an emergent message asking for the user credentials when it is run.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ENLARGE element provides an api to communicate with ENLARGE systems for accessing protected resources. The methods
        are categorized by functionality:
        Connection control:
          <ul>
            <li> <i>connect()</i> Creates a new connection with ENLARGE.</li>
          </ul>
        Session control:
          <ul>
            <li> <i>setTimeout(time)</i> Specify the time for which communications will be enabled. Variable time is
                measured in minutes</li>
            <li> <i>setSarlabCredentials(jsonCredentials)</i> Credentials in JSON format, either {'user':username,
                'password':password} or {'key':keyvalue}. If configured in the element preferences window, this method
                does not need to be called.</li>
          </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Example of use</h3>
    <p>    
        The following code is usually included into an initialization page, and it must be executed to set up the
        connection:
    </p>
    <pre>
        enlarge.setTimeout(10);
        enlarge.connect();
    </pre>
