    <p>
        RIP provides access to other software through internet using JSON-RPC if RIP server is enabled.
        The <i>Remote Interoperability Protocol</i> (RIP) is a means to ease the data exchanging and control of remote
        RIP-enabled hardware or software.
        The protocol is JSON based, so it is human friendly and at the same time can be easily processed by most
        programming languages.
        It also provides autodiscovery, meaning that the server informs about the specific capabilities it implements
        and some details that may be of interest to the user.
    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
        To add the RIP element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your model elements. In the
        configuration dialog, put the URL where the RIP server can be contacted, and click 'Get Server Info' button.
        If the handshake with the server was successful, the combo box 'experiences' presents a list of available
        experiences. Select one of them, and the view will update to show the experience data: description, methods,
        variables, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tab 'Reported Variables' shows the variables the server allows to be read or modified. By right-clicking
        on a variable of the list, one can link with an EJS variable, so the element will handled automatically the
        data transmission, the user being unaware of the internals.
     </p>
    <p>
        The element implements the following basic methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>connect()</i>: Connects with the RIP server in the given IP and port.</li>
        <li><i>get(vars)</i>: : Gets the values of the server variables specified in vars and returns it. Variable vars
        is an array of strings containing the names of the server variables wanted to be retrieved.</li>
        <li><i>set(vars, values)</i>: Sets the values of the server variables vars to values. Variable vars is an array
        of strings containing the names of the server variables wanted to be written. Variable values is a mixed array
        containing the values to send.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example of use:</h3>
    <pre>
        //If not defined, all the callback options will be replaced with an automated version
        //The initial code will be run once
        //The action after evaluation can be edited, only advanced users, to parse or change the variables updating
        rip.connect();					//Uses the server and port from de editor to connect
        rip.set(["doublein"], [0.55]);  //sets the value of the control called "doublein" to 0.55
        value = rip.get(["stringout"]); //gets the value of the indicator "stringout" and returns his value
    </pre>
