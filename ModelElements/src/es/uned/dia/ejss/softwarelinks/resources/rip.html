    </h2>
    <p>
        RIP is to offers a simple, yet powerful, communication solution usable from web clients. As such, RIP only
        uses pure HTTP standard protocols, supported by all major web browsers.
        RIP is designed to communicate web clients with online labs (OLs); either VLs or RLs. When used to
        communicate with a VL, RIP exposes meta-data and input and output methods and variables related to a
        simulation model that is hosted and runs on a computer (usually, a remote server). When used to communicate
        with a RL, RIP does the same thing with a control program defined in a computer (usually, a remote server)
        to monitor and manipulate the lab equipment.

    </p>

    <h3>Usage</h3>
    <p>
        To add the RIP element to your model, drag the icon element to the list of your model elements. In the
        configuration dialog, put the URL where the RIP server can be contacted, and click 'Get Experiences' button.
        If the handshake with the server was successful, the combo box underneath presents a list of available
        methods for communication.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the tab 'Experience', select one of the received experiences using the dropdown menu, and the view will
        update to show data of the methods available to communicate with the experience: name, params and description.
    </p>
    <p>
        The tab 'Auto Update' shows the variables the server allows to be read or modified. By right-clicking
        on a variable of the list, one can link with an EJS variable, so the element will handled automatically the
        data transmission, the user being unaware of the internals.
     </p>
    <p>
        The element implements the following basic methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><i>result = info(callback, expId = null)</i>: When called without this parameter, info() returns meta-data
            with the list of experience identifiers associated to all experiences defined in the OL. It also returns
            more information about the low-level API method call for retrieving meta-data.
            When called with the expId parameter, info(expId) returns meta-data of the referenced experience.</li>
        <li><i>connect(expId, callback)</i>: : When this method is called, the client connects to an SSE in the RIP
            server to: 1) control the user session in the server and 2) receive updates of the variables value in the
            experience defined by expId. Although updates on the server’s variables values are received upon the
            connection, this method returns nothing by itself. </li>
        <li><i>set(variableNames, variableValues, callback, expId)</i>: When this method is called, the values specified
            in variableValues are assigned to the control program’s or simulation model’s variables named as the strings
            in variableNames. The control program or simulation model is determined with the expId parameter.
        </li>
        <li><i>result = get(variableNames, callback, expId)</i>: When this method is called, the values of the control
            program’s or simulation model’s variables named as the strings in variableNames are read and returned. The
            control program or simulation model is determined with the expId parameter. The result returned by this
            method is a mixed array with the current values of the control program’s or simulation model’s variables
            specified in the variableNames input parameter.
        </li>
        The expId parameter is not required for the connect(), get() and set() methods when the RIP element has been
        configured and an experience has already been selected in the dropdown menu in the 'Experience tab.
    </ul>

    <h3>Example of use:</h3>
    <pre>
        //The initial code will be run once
        //The action after evaluation can be edited, only advanced users, to parse or change the variables updating
        rip.connect();					//Uses the server and port from de editor to connect
        rip.set(["doublein"], [0.55]);  //sets the value of the control called "doublein" to 0.55
        value = rip.get(["stringout"]); //gets the value of the indicator "stringout" and returns his value
    </pre>
